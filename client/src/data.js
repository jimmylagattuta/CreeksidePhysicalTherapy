Manual therapy techniques to improve joint mobility and shoulder complex strengthening can get your shoulder moving well and pain-free! Knee pain: Osteoarthritis, dislocations, and sprains all affect the knee's ability to bend and straighten and can result in a loss of strength and function. Strengthening, stretching, and hands-on techniques to improve muscular and joint mobility can be effective in improving your ability to walk, run, squat, or jump. Neck pain: Car accidents, postural strains, and overuse injuries can all affect your neck's ability to move comfortably. Mobilizing the thoracic spine (upper back) and providing hands-on techniques to decrease muscle tension through the neck and shoulders can help to alleviate neck pain.
